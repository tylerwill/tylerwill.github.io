I'm a senior undergraduate studying applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science at Michigan State University, where I am a [University Distinguished Scholar](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/23-high-school-seniors-receive-full-scholarships/).   I'm interested in algorithmic problems with clear societal impacts, often at the intersection of economics and theoretical computer science.  Of particular interest is work that draws on techniques from optimization, probability, and game theory.  In August, I'll begin as a graduate student in the [Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu) doctoral program at Columbia University, likely working on market equilibrium problems and matching market problems with implications for public good.  

In the summer of 2019, I explored the role of artificial intelligence in end-of-life care planning under [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com) as part of the University of Maryland's [NSF CAAR REU](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/).  Prior to that, I helped develop new theory that links deep learning and topic modeling techniques under [Prof. Deanna Needell](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/) at UCLA's [Applied Mathematics REU](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2017.html).  During the school year, I've been developing software to help attack a complicated multi-objective rocket burning problem with [Prof. Erik Goodman](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~goodman/).

I'm an avid college basketball fan (it's hard not to be at MSU), Buffalo Bills supporter (hometown blood runs deep), and a bow tie aficionado (as you can see).  In my spare time, I'm an amateur cook and an even more amateur [judoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo).
