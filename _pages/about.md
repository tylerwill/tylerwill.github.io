**I'm applying to graduate programs in computer science and operations research to start in Fall 2020!**
{: .notice}

I'm a senior undergraduate studying applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science at Michigan State University, where I am a [University Distinguished Scholar](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/23-high-school-seniors-receive-full-scholarships/).   I'm interested in algorithmic problems with direct societal impacts such as those in resource allocation, computational social choice, and fair artificial intelligence.  I'm particularly partial to work that draws on techniques from optimization, probability, and game theory.  My Erd√∂s number is 4.  

In the summer of 2019, I explored the role of artificial intelligence in end-of-life care planning under Prof. John Dickerson as part of the University of Maryland's [NSF CAAR REU](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/).  Prior to that, I helped develop new theory that links deep learning and topic modeling techniques under Prof. Deanna Needell at UCLA's [Applied Mathematics REU](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2017.html).  During the school year, I've been doing rocket science with Prof. Erik Goodman.

I'm an avid college basketball and college football fan.  At MSU, it's hard not to be the first, and it's hard to be the second.
