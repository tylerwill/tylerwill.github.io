I'm a master's student in [Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu) at Columbia University with an expected graduation in August 2021.  I'm currently looking for an impactful full-time role in technology that leverages both my broad mathematical background and programming skills.


I did my undergrad in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science at Michigan State University, where I was a [University Distinguished Scholar](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/23-high-school-seniors-receive-full-scholarships/).  When I wasn't watching MSU basketball, I worked on a number of different projects and developed skills ranging from data analysis to software development.  In the summer of 2019, I explored the role of artificial intelligence in end-of-life care planning under [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com) as part of the University of Maryland's [NSF CAAR REU](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/).  Prior to that, I helped develop new theory that links deep learning and topic modeling techniques under [Prof. Deanna Needell](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/) at UCLA's [Applied Mathematics REU](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2017.html).  During my later years at MSU, I wrote software to attack a complicated multi-objective rocket burning problem with [Prof. Erik Goodman](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~goodman/).

I'm an avid college basketball fan (thanks to my time at MSU), Buffalo Bills supporter (hometown blood runs deep), and a bow tie aficionado.  In my spare time, I'm an amateur cook and an even more amateur [judoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo).
