I'm a senior undergraduate studying applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science at Michigan State University, where I am a [University Distinguished Scholar](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/23-high-school-seniors-receive-full-scholarships/).   I'm interested in algorithmic problems with direct societal impacts, such as in resource allocation problems at the intersection of economics and computer science and in building fair, ethical artificial intelligence.  My Erd√∂s number is 4.  

I explored the role of artificial intelligence in end-of-life care planning under Prof. John Dickerson as part of the University of Maryland's [NSF CAAR REU](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/).  Prior to that, I helped develop new theory that links deep learning and topic modeling techniques under Prof. Deanna Needell at [UCLA's Applied Mathematics REU](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/WORKFORCE/REU2017.html).  During the school year, I've been doing rocket science with Prof. Erik Goodman!
